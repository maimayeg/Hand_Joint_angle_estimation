1. How many degrees of freedom (DOF) does each joint have?

	Thumb Joints:
		Carpometacarpal (CMC) Joint:
		2 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension (moving across the palm or away from it).
		Abduction/Adduction (moving away or toward the other fingers).
		This joint also allows some rotation, but the primary motion is a combination of these two.
		Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joint:
		2 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension.
		Abduction/Adduction (but limited).
		Interphalangeal (IP) Joint:
		1 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension (bending or straightening).
	Fingers (Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky) Joints:
		Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joint:
		2 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension (bending or straightening).
		Abduction/Adduction (moving fingers apart or together).
		Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) Joint:
		1 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension (bending or straightening).
		Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) Joint:
		1 DOF:
		Flexion/Extension (bending or straightening).

2. Is there a way to compute the rotation matrices for each joint from their joint angles?

	Yes, the rotation matrix can be computed using the joint angles. For example, given an angle 𝜃, the 2D rotation matrix is:
		𝑅(𝜃) = 
		[cos 𝜃  −sin 𝜃]
		[sin 𝜃   cos 𝜃]
	In this matrix, theta represents the angle of rotation. The matrix describes how the point's coordinates will change after
	rotation. The cos(𝜃) and sin(𝜃) values represent how much the point shifts along the X and Y axes during the rotation.
	For rotations in 3D, the situation becomes more complex because rotation can occur around any of the three axes: X, Y, or Z.
	The rotation matrix will depend on the specific axis of rotation. For example:
	Rotation around the X-axis:
	R_x(𝜃) =
	[ 1     0         0    ]
	[ 0   cos(𝜃)   -sin(𝜃) ]
	[ 0   sin(𝜃)    cos(𝜃) ]
	Rotation around the Y-axis:
	R_y(𝜃) =
	[ cos(𝜃)   0   sin(𝜃) ]
	[     0    1       0  ]
	[ -sin(𝜃)  0   cos(𝜃) ]
	Rotation around the Z-axis:
	R_z(𝜃) =
	[ cos(𝜃)   -sin(𝜃)   0 ]
	[ sin(𝜃)    cos(𝜃)   0 ]
	[  0          0      1 ]






	
3. How do we compute the length of each bone of the hand?

	The length of each bone can be calculated by finding the Euclidean distance between two connected joint points:
	Each joint point has 3D coordinates: (x1, y1, z1) for the first joint and (x2, y2, z2) for the second joint.
	The formula of calculating the the length of the bone would be:
	length = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)
